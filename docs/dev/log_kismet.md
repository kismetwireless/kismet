# Under Development

These docs represent a logfile which is under current development; until the first full release is done, the contents of the Kismet log are subject to change as corner cases are found.

# Kismet Log File

The Kismet log file contains all the information gathered by Kismet about devices, supported phy types, packets, GPS coordinates during logging, and similar.  Under previous versions of Kismet, this data could be found in disparate logs such as gpsxml, netxml, nettxt, and pcap.

## Internal Log Structure

The Kismet log file is stored as a sqlite3 database, however it is not designed as a traditional strictly normalized database.

In order to support the arbitrary data collected by Kismet about different phy layers and any  Kismet plugins that may have been loaded, the Kismet log contains basic normalized fields such as location, timestamp, and device keys, but the majority of the data is stored as a serialized JSON object or as binary packet data.

This means that basic queries (time, signal levels, location, device identifiers, and MAC addresses) can be done via SQL queries, but more complex queries will require retrieving the JSON object.

## Data Formats

The Kismet log uses a few consistent formats for data:

### Timestamps

Timestamps are stored as integer seconds since the epoch for low-precision timestamps, and integer seconds since the epoch plus a second field of milliseconds for high-precision timestamps.  This format matches the unix timestamp tv_sec and tv_usec format.

### GPS

To simplify storing and portability of GPS coordinates, they are normalized from floating-point numbers to integers.

This format matches the PPI GPS records and the internal representation of floating-precision data in Kismet (both of which strive to minimize math precision issues and binary portability issues).

Latitude and Longitude are normalized to a 6-digit precision integer using the conversion:
*normalized_coord = (coordinate * 100000)*

### GPS Bounding and Average Coordinates

GPS bounding coordinates are stored as 4 values, the minimum extreme latitude and longitude, and the maximum extreme latitude and longitude.  These values define a bounding box which encloses all instances where a device was seen.

The GPS average location is calculated by Kismet as a running average of all packets; this can be the least precise method of isolating the location of a device because it can be heavily influenced by the sampling pattern.  For more precise location calculations, post-processing of the GPS records in the `PACKET` or `DATA` tables will yield better results.

### Device Keys

Device keys are used to uniquely identify a device; the device key is used by Kismet as the indexing value for every device record, and incorporates the unique Kismet server which saw the device, the phy layer driver which processed the device, and the device-specific unique identifier (often the MAC address but not always).

Internally keys are represented as 128-bit numbers, in the Kismet log they are represented as a TEXT field; each device key will be unique.

### UUIDs

UUIDs, or globally unique identifiers, are used in Kismet to identify specific instances of some long-living objects such as the Kismet server itself and data sources.  UUIDs are stored in the Kismet log as a TEXT blob of the UUID string.

## Log Sections

The Kismet log is divided into multiple sections (stored internally as SQLite3 tables).

### Alerts

The `alerts` section holds records of Kismet IDS alerts.

| Field   |          Type | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |

### Data

The `data` section holds arbitrary data records which are *not* packets but which have temporal or locational meaning; typically these will be generated by non-packet-based data sources such as the `sdr-rtl433` source which detects device events but does not supply the raw original bytes.

| Field      |          Type | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |

### Datasource

The `datasource` section holds up-to-date information about the datasources Kismet is capturing from; a data source supplies information to Kismet and can be local, remote, packet-based, or event-based.

| Field      | Type   | Description                                                  |

| json       | *json* | Full device state (packet RRD, messages, etc) as JSON blob   |

### Devices

The `device` section holds complete Kismet device objects; the device object is encoded as a JSON object and contains all phy-related data and all tracked notes, data, and any other information about the device.

| Field            |          Type | Description                                                  |

### Messages

The `messages` section holds text messages from Kismet; typically printed to the 'Messages' section of the UI or to the console.

| Field   |          Type | Description                                               |

| lon     | *gps integer* | GPS longitude, as normalized integer                      |
| msgtype |        *text* | Message type/category (`INFO`, `ERROR`, `ALERT`, `FATAL`) |
| message |        *text* | Arbitrary message as printed by Kismet                    |

### Packets

The `packets` section holds raw binary packets; packets can be of any DLT (data link type) supported by Kismet, and are tagged with per-packet GPS location (when available).

The `packets` section is directly analogous to a pcap (or pcap-ng) file and can be directly converted to those formats with tools found in `log_tools/` in the Kismet directory.

Packets are stored in the raw, original capture format; in the case of Wi-Fi this may be a format such as Radiotap which, itself, also encodes the frequency, signal levels, and detailed antenna data.  Kismet exposes a normalized subset of per-packet data to facilitate slicing the Kismet log into manageable pieces easily.

| Field      |          Type | Description                                                  |

| packet     |        *blob* | Raw binary packet content                                    |
| error      |         *int* | Boolean, packet was flagged by Kismet as an error in rx or otherwise invalid due to parsing errors |

### Snapshots

The `snapshots` section holds arbitrary time-based snapshots of data; this functions as a catch-all for Kismet plugins and other temporal data.

| Field    |          Type | Description                                |

## REST API

If the Kismet Databaselog is enabled, Kismet will expose an API for extracting historic data.  If the databaselog is not enabled, these APIs will not be available and will return an error.

The REST API is documented in the kismet_rest file in docs/dev/
