# Packet sources:
# source=capture_cardtype,capture_interface,capture_name
# Card type - Specifies the type of device. It can be one of:
#     cisco         - Cisco card with Linux Kernel drivers 
#     cisco_cvs     - Cisco card with CVS Linux drivers
#     cisco_bsd     - Cisco on *BSD
#     prism2        - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers with pcap support (all 
#                      current versions support pcap)
#     prism2_hostap - Prism2 using hostap drivers
#     prism2_legacy - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers without pcap support (0.1.9)
#     prism2_bsd    - Prism2 on *BSD
#     orinoco       - Orinoco cards using Snax's patched driers
#     generic       - Generic card with no specific support.  You will have 
#                      to put this into monitor mode yourself!
#     wsp100        - WSP100 embedded remote sensor.  
#     wtapfile      - Saved file of packets readable by libwiretap
# Capture interface - Specifies the network interface Kismet will watch for
#  packets to come in on.  Typically "ethX" or "wlanX".  For the WSP100 capture
#  engine, the WSP100 device sends packets via a UDP stream, so the capture
#  interface should be in the form of host:port where 'host' is the WSP100 and 
#  'port' is the local UDP port that it will send data to.
# Capture Name      - The name Kismet uses for this capture source.  This is the 
#   name used to specify what sources to enable.
# 
# To enable multiple sources, specify a source line for each and then use the
# enablesources line to enable them.  For example:
# source=prism2,wlan0,prism
# source=cisco,eth0,cisco

source=prism2_legacy,eth0,Kismet

# Comma-separated list of sources to enable.  This is only needed if you wish 
# to selectively enable multiple sources.
# enablesources=prism,cisco

# Do we have a GPS?
gps=false
# Host:port that GPSD is running on.  This can be localhost OR remote!
gpshost=localhost:2947

# How often (in seconds) do we write all our data files (0 to disable)
writeinterval=300

# Do we use sound?
# Not to be confused with GUI sound parameter, this controls wether or not the
# server itself will play sound.  Primarily for headless or automated systems.

# Path to sound player

# Optional parameters to pass to the player
# soundopts=--volume=.3

# Similar to the logtemplate option, this lets you customize the speech output.
# speech_encrypted is used for an encrypted network spoken string
# speech_unencrypted is used for an unencrypted network spoken string

# %b is replaced by the BSSID (MAC) of the network

# %n is replaced by the logging instance name
# %d is replaced by the current date as Mon-DD-YYYY

# %t is replaced by the starting log time
# %i is replaced by the increment log in the case of multiple logs
# %l is replaced by the log type (dump, status, crypt, etc)
# %h is replaced by the home directory
# ie, "netlogs/%n-%d-%i.dump" called with a logging name of "Pok" could expand
# to something like "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-1.dump" for the first instance and 
# "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.%l" for the second logfile generated.
# %h/netlots/%n-%d-%i.dump could expand to
# /home/foo/netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.dump
#
# Other possibilities:  Sorting by directory
# logtemplate=%l/%n-%d-%i
# Would expand to, for example,
# dump/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# crypt/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# and so on.  The "dump", "crypt", etc, dirs must exist before kismet is run
