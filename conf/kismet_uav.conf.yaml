# The Kismet UAV config file is generated from this source format via
# tools/generate_uav.py

- header: |
    This config file is generated from the YAML definitions in 
    conf/kismet_uav.conf.yaml, changes should be made there.

    uavmatch= options can be placed in included config files as well.

    The UAV/Drone phy can match against UAVs based on the presence of specific
    telemetry data packets, or based on characteristics such as the manufacturer
    and SSID.
    
    Manufacturer definitions define several possible matches, and are defined with:
    uav_match=matchname,option1="...",option2="..."
    
    The matchname is a unique identifier for this rule set.  Options must include:
     name="...", the manufacturer of the UAV
     
    The options may also include:
     model="...", the specific model of the UAV
    
    Matches are performed on the mac address of the device, the advertised SSID,
    or both:
     mac=mac/mask, the mac address and macmask filter.  To match by the OUI, 
       specify the first 3 bytes of the mac and a mask of FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
     ssid="regex", a regex to match against the SSID.  This regex is a standard
       PCRE regular expression.
    
    A UAV must meet both the mac address and SSID regex filters, if both are
    specified.  To match on either value, optionally specify:
     match_any=true
