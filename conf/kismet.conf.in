# Kismet config file
# Most of the "static" configs have been moved to here -- the command line
# config was getting way too crowded and cryptic.  We want functionality,
# not continually reading --help!

# Version of Kismet config
version=2017

# Include optional site-local config options.  If this config file is not
# present, it will be ignored. The option also supports glob pattern matching 
# for specifying sets of filenames.

# Include the httpd config options
# %E is expanded to the system etc path configured at install

# Where capture binaries are allowed to live; for security reasons capture
# binaries are only executed from these directories
capture_binary_path=%B/kismet_capture_tools/

# Kismet can accept connections from remote capture datasources; by default this 
# is enabled on the loopback interface *only*.  It's recommended that the remote
# capture socket stay bound to the loopback local interface, and additional
# authentication - such as SSH tunnels - is used.  Check the Kismet README for
# more information about setting up remote capture securely!

# logprefix=/some/path/to/logs


# See the README for more information how to define sources; sources take the
# form of:
# source=interface:options
#
# For example to capture from a Wi-Fi interface in Linux you could specify:
# source=wlan0
#
# or to specify a custom name,
# source=wlan0:name=ath9k
#
# Sources may be defined in the config file or on the command line via the 
# '-c' option.  Sources may also be defined live via the WebUI.


# Default behavior of capture sources; if there are no options passed on the source
# definition to control hopping, hop rate, or other attributes, these are applied

# Hop channels if possible
channel_hop=true

# How fast do we hop channels?  Time can be hops/second or hops/minute.
channel_hop_speed=5/sec

# If we have multiple sources with the same type, Kismet can try to split
# them up so that they hop from different starting positions; this maximizes the
# coverage
split_source_hopping=true

# Should Kismet scramble the channel list so that it hops in a semi-random pattern?
# This helps sources like Wi-Fi where many channels are adjacent and can overlap, 
# by randomizing 2.4ghz channels Kismet can take advantage of the overlap.  Typically
# leave this turned on.
randomized_hopping=true

# Should sources be re-opened when they encounter an error?
retry_on_source_error=true

# Should we override remote sources timestamps?  If you do not have NTP coordinating
# the time between your remote capture devices, you may see unusual behavior if the
# system clocks are drastically different.
override_remote_timestamp=true

# New GPS configuration
# gps=type:options
#
# gps=serial:device=/dev/ttyACM0,name=laptop
# gps=gpsd:host=localhost,port=2947
# gps=virtual:lat=123.45,lon=45.678,alt=1234

# Do we process the contents of data frames?  If this is enabled, data
# frames will be truncated to the headers only immediately after frame type
# detection.  This will disable IP detection, etc, however it is likely
# safer (and definitely more polite) if monitoring networks you do not own.
# hidedata=true

# Do we allow plugins to be used?  This will load plugins from the system
# and user plugin directiories when set to true (See the README for the default
# plugin locations).
allowplugins=true

# For long-running instances of Kismet in a WIDS style usage, it may be 
# useful to limit the amount of memory kismet will consume, with the
# following tuning values:

# Time, in seconds, for devices to be tracked when idle.  By default, devices
# are kept forever, however in RAM constrained environments it may be preferable
# to stop tracking older devices.
# Devices which are removed will be detected as new devices without historical
# data if they are detected a second time.
# Example timeout of 2 hours (60*60*2)
#
# tracker_device_timeout=7200

# Maximum number of devices allowed in the tracker.  If this is reached, older
# devices will be purged, and if they are detected again, will show up as new 
# devices without historical data.
#
# tracker_max_devices=10000

# Packet filtering options:
# filter_tracker - Packets filtered from the tracker are not processed or
#                  recorded in any way.
# filter_export  - Controls what packets influence the exported CSV, network,
#                  xml, gps, etc files.
# All filtering options take arguments containing the type of address and
# addresses to be filtered.  Valid address types are 'ANY', 'BSSID',
# 'SOURCE', and 'DEST'.  Filtering can be inverted by the use of '!' before
# the address.  For example,
# filter_tracker=ANY(!"00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF")
# has the same effect as the previous mac_filter config file option.

# Alerts to be reported and the throttling rates.
# alert=name,throttle/unit,burst
# The throttle/unit describes the number of alerts of this type that are
# sent per time unit.  Valid time units are second, minute, hour, and day.
# Burst describes the number of alerts sent before throttling takes place.
# For example:
# alert=FOO,10/min,5
# Would allow 5 alerts through before throttling is enabled, and will then
# limit the number of alerts to 10 per minute.
# A throttle rate of 0 disables throttling of the alert.
