# Assign operating channel to sources who don't advertise after X amount of freqs 
# compare true to an initial sample freq. This helps prevent wild flucuations in 
# the displayed channel for devices in the web UI.
# Generally, leave this set to 0, unless you see false channels in UI for wireless 
# devices. The higher the value the longer it will take to assign a channel. 
# Results may vary depending on card & overall network conditions. Channels
# should either match control or be within overlap.

# is hidden; for example an 802.11AC device may be visible to a non-802.11AC 
# sniffer when it sends lower data-rate PHY packets.
# Unfortunately, many devices (especially ath9k) also corrupt these frames, leading

# Kismet manages multiple views of the device data; one of these views is for 802.11 access
# points (and access-point-like devices which send probe responses).  This takes additional
# memory (though, a relatively small amount).  In very high access point environments, you
# might wish to turn off some or all of the additional views.
# If the access point view is turned off, access points WILL STILL BE TRACKED, there just
# won't be a dedicated view in the UI for them.

# Kismet manages a view of SSIDs independent of devices; in extremely high access point
# environments, you might wish to turn this off to save memory.  SSIDs will still be logged and
