# 802.11-specific configuration options

# 802.11 PHY frames are typically visible even when the data from the same devices 
# is hidden; for example an 802.11AC device may be visible to a non-802.11AC 
# sniffer when it sends lower data-rate PHY packets.
# Unfortunately, many devices (especially ath9k) also corrupt these frames, leading
# to tremendous false device detection.
# If you're sure your capture device doesn't generate bogus info, you can turn these on.
dot11_process_phy=false

# Kismet manages multiple views of the device data; one of these views is for 802.11 access
# points (and access-point-like devices which send probe responses).  This takes additional
# memory (though, a relatively small amount).  In very high access point environments, you
# might wish to turn off some or all of the additional views.
# If the access point view is turned off, access points WILL STILL BE TRACKED, there just
# won't be a dedicated view in the UI for them.

# Enable device fingerprinting.  This is *required* to use the whitelisting features, but
# uses more RAM to store the fingerprints.
dot11_fingerprint_devices=true

# Access point fingerprinting is done in part by hashing IE tags to determine if
# they have changed.  Typically you shouldn't change this, but if you need to, you can change
# the IE tag numbers used to compute the hash here.  If you change this, you may invalidate any
# saved hashes in an existing whitelist.

# Fingerprinting is only available when dot11_fingerprint_devices=true
#
# IE221 is special, as it contains a number of sub-values.  These are indicated as
