Kismet Service (and Debug Service)

# Purpose

    The Kismet service runs Kismet, via systemd.  For running Kismet under full debug mode
    (for helping with development or tracking down errors), see the README in the
    kismet_debug/ directory.

# Installing

    To install Kismet as a systemd service you'll need to copy one file:

        $ sudo cp kismet.service /lib/systemd/system/

# Configuring

    By default, the Kismet systemd service runs Kismet as root; this is NOT best practices
    but it is the only user consistently available.

    It is STONGLY recommended that you install Kismet as suid-root via `make suidinstall`,
    and that you run Kismet as a non-privileged user.  Kismet will then limit root 
    access to the capture binaries which control individual interfaces.

    To set up Kismet to run as a user, first follow the install directions in the Kismet
    README file, and install the Kismet systemd service as above.  Then, use the
    `systemctl edit` command to configure the Kismet server; for instance if you want to
    run Kismet as the user 'kismet':

        $ sudo systemctl edit kismet

    `systemctl edit` will open an editor; set the following options:

        [Service]
        User=kismet
        Group=kismet

    and save.  Now systemd will start Kismet as the 'kismet' user.  If you want to 
    automatically start Kismet as some other user (such as the one you normally log in as), 
    put that user in the User= line.

# Activating

    To start Kismet via systemd:

        $ sudo service kismet start

    To start Kismet by default on boot:

        $ sudo systemctl enable kismet
