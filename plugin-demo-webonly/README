Demo plugin for web-only content
--------------------------------

This plugin shows how to create a basic, web-only plugin - this plugin has no
C++ code, it exists entirely as add-ons to the Kismet web UI.

As a basic demo, this plugin does nothing but show how a web-only plugin is
structured and provides the very basic Makefile needed to install it.

For more information on how to write plugins and interface with the Kismet
web ui framework, look at docs/dev/
