# Kismet config file
# Most of the "static" configs have been moved to here -- the command line
# config was getting way too crowded and cryptic.  We want functionality,
# not continually reading --help!

# Version of Kismet config
version=2.7.1g

# Name of server (Purely for organiational purposes)
servername=Kismet

# MAC addresses to filter, comma seperated. 
#macfilter=DE:AD:BE:EF:00:00

# User to setid to (should be your normal user)
suiduser=your_user_here

# Port to serve GUI data
tcpport=2501
# People allowed to connect, comma seperated, IPs
allowedhosts=127.0.0.1
# Maximum number of concurrent GUI's
maxclients=5

# Packet sources:
# Source#=capture_cardtype,capture_interface,capture_name
# Card type - Specifies the type of device. It can be one of:
#     cisco         - Cisco card with Linux Kernel drivers 
#     cisco_cvs     - Cisco card with CVS Linux drivers
#     cisco_bsd     - Cisco on *BSD
#     prism2        - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers with pcap support (all 
#                      current versions support pcap)
#     prism2_hostap - Prism2 using hostap drivers
#     prism2_legacy - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers without pcap support (0.1.9)
#     prism2_bsd    - Prism2 on *BSD
#     orinoco       - Orinoco cards using Snax's patched driers
#     generic       - Generic card with no specific support.  You will have 
#                      to put this into monitor mode yourself!
#     wsp100        - WSP100 embedded remote sensor.  
#     wtapfile      - Saved file of packets readable by libwiretap
# Capture interface - Specifies the network interface Kismet will watch for
#  packets to come in on.  Typically "ethX" or "wlanX".  For the WSP100 capture
#  engine, the WSP100 device sends packets via a UDP stream, so the capture
#  interface should be in the form of host:port where 'host' is the WSP100 and 
#  'port' is the local UDP port that it will send data to.
# Capture Name - Purely informational, this allows you to name each interface
#  for easier identification.
# Multiple packet sources:
# Kismet will read packet sources starting at 0 and incrementing until a source
# line isn't found.  To capture from 2 pcap prism2 cards you'd define:
# source0=prism2,wlan0,Card Zero
# source1=prism2,wlan1,Card One

source0=cisco,eth0,Kismet


# Do we have a GPS?
gps=true
# Host:port that GPSD is running on.  This can be localhost OR remote!
gpshost=localhost:2947

# How often (in seconds) do we write all our data files (0 to disable)
writeinterval=300

# Do we use sound?
# Not to be confused with GUI sound parameter, this controls wether or not the
# server itself will play sound.  Primarily for headless or automated systems.
sound=false
# Path to sound player
soundplay=/usr/bin/play
# Optional parameters to pass to the player
# soundopts=--volume=.3

# Alert sound

# Does the server have speech? (Again, not to be confused with the GUI's speech)
speech=false
# Server's path to Festival
festival=/usr/bin/festival
# How do we speak?  Valid options:
# speech    Normal speech
# nato      NATO spellings (alpha, bravo, charlie)
# spell     Spell the letters out (aye, bee, sea)
speech_type=nato
# speech_encrypted and speech_unencrypted - Speech templates
# Similar to the logtemplate option, this lets you customize the speech output.
# speech_encrypted is used for an encrypted network spoken string
# speech_unencrypted is used for an unencrypted network spoken string
#
# %b is replaced by the BSSID (MAC) of the network
# %s is replaced by the SSID (name) of the network
# %c is replaced by the CHANNEL of the network
# %r is replaced by the MAX RATE of the network

# File types to log, comma seperated
# dump    - raw packet dump

# What type of dump do we generate? 
# valid option: "wiretap" 
dumptype=wiretap
# Do we limit the size of dump logs?  Sometimes ethereal can't handle big ones.
# 0 = No limit
# Anything else = Max number of packets to log to a single file before closing

# logtemplate - Filename logging template.
# This is, at first glance, really nasty and ugly, but you'll hardly ever
# have to touch it so don't complain too much.
#
# %n is replaced by the logging instance name
# %d is replaced by the current date
# %t is replaced by the starting log time
# %i is replaced by the increment log in the case of multiple logs
# %l is replaced by the log type (dump, status, crypt, etc)
# %h is replaced by the home directory
# ie, "netlogs/%n-%d-%i.dump" called with a logging name of "Pok" could expand
# to something like "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-1.dump" for the first instance and 
# "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.%l" for the second logfile generated.
# %h/netlots/%n-%d-%i.dump could expand to
# /home/foo/netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.dump
#
# Other possibilities:  Sorting by directory
# logtemplate=%l/%n-%d-%i
# Would expand to, for example,
# dump/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# crypt/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# and so on.  The "dump", "crypt", etc, dirs must exist before kismet is run
# in this case.
