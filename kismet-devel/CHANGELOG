Aug 08 2003  3.0.1  Released 3.0.1 stable.  No new major changes, but plenty of
                     bugfixes.

Aug 06 2003  3.0.1  Added cardtype initializer, might solve issue on arm
                    Added link to libstdc++ for compilers that don't link it
Aug 05 2003  3.0.1  Fixed capchildren failing on open not killing server
                    Fixed min/max gps coord tracking
Aug 04 2003  3.0.1  Added pcapfile capture source (nearly the same function as
                     wtapfile but doesn't need ethereal)
                    Merged panelfront gps fixes from mdmcl
Aug 03 2003  3.0.1  Added --help to kismet script
                    Fixed gps after breaking it yesterday

                    Fixed stray gps debug string (mdmcl)
                    Removed ability to disable gps in configure.  It didn't
                     save enough to be worth it and the new code doesn't like
                     gps not being there.
Jul 31 2003  3.0.1  Added PROBENORESP alert
                    Fixed always trying to log gps info

                     Mac OSX support
                     Stateful packet inspector
                     New alert system
                     Uncountable bugfixes and updates
                    BE SURE TO READ THE README WHEN UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS
                    VERSION OF KISMET!  MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED!
                     
Jul 30 2003  2.9.1  Hopefully fixed compass for real this time
Jul 29 2003  2.9.1  Moved to libpcap 0.7.2 stable.  Use cvs update -P to prune
                     out the old directories automatically.
Jul 24 2003  2.9.1  Fixed cisco and cisco_cvs to not try to hop
                    Updated config file man page
                    Rewrote CSV export log
Jul 23 2003  2.9.1  Fixed vihasource gps call
                    Updated gpsd.h to use inttypes.h if present
                    Updated panel compass to (hopefully) be not broken now.
                    Merged patch from tz to fix trimming last 4 bytes of 
                     decrypt-mangled packets.
Jul 22 2003  2.9.1  Integrated not-broken heading code from gkismet to do 
                     software heading calcs.  Hopefully I didn't break it. Fix
                     to compass coming soon.
                    Changed FCS trimming to only trim prism2 and prism2_avs
                     card types.
Jul 21 2003  2.9.1  Added gpsmodelock config file option to override a gps lock
                     of 0.  This will override broken GPS units that always 
                     report no lock via gpsd.
                    Added heading support for GPS units with magnetic compasses.
                     This requires a patched gpsd, patch is in extra/
Jul 20 2003  2.9.1  Revamped how GPS is handled, should fix problems of it
                     losing locks constantly.

                    Added some other paths to kismet_monitor for binaries
                    Fixed prism2_avs capture source
                    Added decrypted network tag to display
                    Changed tcpclient.cc to use fixed field lists to make it
                     compatable with other versions of kismet_server
Jun 21 2003  2.9.1  Added tcpclient hooks for cardlist
Jun 20 2003  2.9.1  Added CARD protocol to report card info to client
                    Minor tweak to how children link to GPS

                    Updated docs to reflect Viha support
Jun 14 2003  2.9.1  Tweaked queuing order of fatal text messages in IPC
Jun 11 2003  2.9.1  I hate IPC.  Replaced entire stream-pipe IPC core with
                     unix dgram sockets and it works much better.
                    Added IPC command acks to throttle channel hopping if the
                     card can't support changing as quickly as requested.
Jun 10 2003  2.9.1  Yet more work on the IPC.  More issues resolved.
                    Added code to silence capchildren if server it silent
Jun 09 2003  2.9.1  Tweaked configure to strip debugging symbols from OSX
                     OSX builds.  Some OSX gcc's are broken.
                    Worked on capchild IPC more.  Maybe this will finally fix
                     blocking and multisource issues.
Jun 08 2003  2.9.1  Tweaked kismet_monitor to set PATH var for suidinstalls
                    Tweaked IPC code to try to prevent blocking lockups.
                    Revamped packetsource opening in capchildren.

                     hopping)
Jun 06 2003  2.9.1  Implemented wireless-extention IOCTL fetching of current
                     channel for the appropriate capture types.
                    Caught capture sources that don't return valid fd's to the
                     capture client select() loop.  We just die for now.
                    Tweaked channel change alert tests
                    Added wait4() pausing for client capsources to exit
                    Added signalling to terminate client capsources
                    Removed broken signalling and added correct child capsource
                     termination.
Jun 04 2003  2.9.1  Implemented dronesource buffer resyncs
                    Updated kismet_drone to use new forked packet paths

                    Fixed include in PanelFront for OSX
                    Added CXX and LD flags for Viha
                    Added detection of system-level nongnu getopt
                    Removed CXX flags for viha, only need ld

                     change during implementation)
May 24 2003  2.9.1  Removed sequence spoof detector (for now) since it didn't
                     do much useful
                    Added disassociate/deauth spoof detector
                    Documented other alerts

                    File reorganization.
May 22 2003  2.9.1  Absorbed kismet_monitor into kismet_server, changed suid
                     root behavior.  READ THE DOCS.

Mar 28 2003  2.9.1  Updated configure to look for ethereal 0.9.10
                    Updated configure to work with autoconfig 2.57... stupid
                     autoconf 2.57 broke things that shouldn't have been broke.
                    Modified cisco_cvs capture type to be ethX:wifiX
Mar 25 2003  2.9.1  More streamlining of internal GPS process, proper 
                     preservation of packet timestamp.
                    Expanded max packet size and added protection for
                     ssid terminator for turbocel packets.
Mar 23 2003  2.9.1  Revamped internal GPS handling, minor other tweaks.

Mar 20 2003  2.9.1  Various code cleanups and reorganizations
                    Removed alert filter string, too unwieldy from the code
                     and redundant
                    Migrated rest of alerts to new alert backend, removed
                     GSTSRCH alert (should be in L3 IDS like snort)
                    Fixed lots of CVS errors of mis-added files
                    Reduced internal packet buffer to 2048.  Minor memory
                     savings.
                    Migrated drone output to a per-listener ring buffer, fixed
                     spin condition when listener disconnects inbetween writes,

                     file, started moving existing alerts to new alert
                     logic.
Mar 17 2003  2.9.1  Worked on new alert throttling framework.  Alerts are 
                     probably broken right now for the client.
Mar 16 2003  2.9.1  Switched (returned) to statically allocated packet buffers
                     for a minor speed improvement.
                    Removed ability to filter outbound drone streams since it
                     would break badly if a client didn't connect immediately.
                    Restructured timer code
Mar 13 2003  2.9.1  Removed redundant select() in several capture sources
                    Fixed drone capture source dropping dead under high loads
                    Fixed wtaplocaldump compile errors

                     header
                    Added packet source logging to gpsxml, updated DTD
Mar 06 2003  2.9.1  Added 802.11 FHSS/DSSS distinction
                    Added encoding and data rate tracking
                    Changed DTD versioning to match kismet version
                    Included old DTD's in cvs again
Mar 05 2003  2.9.1  Fixed prism2 dropping FCS (should fix wep decoding)
                    Added additional wlanctl-ng commands to initialize the card
                     more cleanly, should help with some setups.
                    Added initial wlan-ng 0.2.0 AVS header support
Feb 26 2003  2.9.1  Changed named pipe to log all packets, not just data.
Feb 25 2003  2.9.1  Fixed Makefile.in for kismet_drone

                     columns.
Feb 23 2003  2.9.1  Spun server timer events into seperate file
                    Created kismet_drone, a 'headless' tcp/ip packet streamer.
                     kismet_drone has all the same capture sources as Kismet
                     itself, however instead of processing the packets, it
                     makes them available via a TCP/IP stream, which enables
                     a lightweight network of capture drones monitored by a
                     central kismet for loggig/detection/etc.  Docs and
                     kismet stream capture source coming soon.
                    Added new kismet capture source, Drone.  Capture interface
                     is host:port, where the host and port are that of the 
                     Drone remote capture.
                    Updated drone code to have versioning for future revisions
                    Migrated capture source parsing/binding to common file to
                     reduce code bloat.
Feb 22 2003  2.9.1  Added 'TODO' file to CVS after enough people complained
                     that it wasn't there.
Feb 21 2003  2.9.1  Wrote code to mangle a WEP'd packet into a non-wep'd one
                    Added ability to write data frames to a FIFO named pipe
                     for external utilities such as Snort to do layer3+ IDS.
                    Updated documentation for FIFO IDS pipe.
Feb 19 2003  2.9.1  Development has been slow lately.  Sorry.
                    Removed pthreads requirement for gpsmap.  This should let 
                     us compile and run on *BSD systems now.
Feb 09 2003  2.9.1  Added timer scheduler for (future) plugins and WSP100
                     wakeup packets.
                    Merged modified patch from gherlein to issue WSP100 wakeups
                    Converted timed server tasks to scheduled timer tasks

                    Fixed multi-server connecting, grouping bug still present
Feb 06 2003  2.9.1  Added masking capability to MAC addresses and filters, 
                     reduced memory usage slightly.
Feb 05 2003  2.9.1  Fixed minor gpsmap netxml-search-path bug that didn't 
                     handle netxml in the current directory.
                    Revamped filtering mechanism to be far more flexable and
                     useful.  See the config file and man page.
Feb 03 2003  2.9.1  Fixed some alerts being reported as notifications
Feb 01 2003  2.9.1  Merged patch from Pedro to fix memory faults on some BSDs.
                    Added ability to include subconfig files (containing, for
                     example, WEP keys)
Jan 31 2003  2.9.1  Merged new patch from Anton for power-level scatter plots.

                     upgrade your linux-wireless-tools to version 25 or you 
                     will not be able to place the card into monitor mode.)
                    Added network carrier classification (802.11, 11b, 11a,
                     etc)

                     Anyone fetching updates from CVS should use the -P flag to
                     prune empty directories.
                    Updated README w/ new documentation, merged most of the docs/
                     directory into one file.
                    More 2.8 docs updates
Dec 22 2002  2.7.1  Fixed multiserver alert displays in panels frontend
                    Fixed adhoc network handling - it once again uses the 
                     actual advertised BSSID, but this may result in a creeping
                     list of networks as the firmware changes its bssid
                     continually.
                    Fixed very stupid pointer math which caused several issues
Dec 20 2002  2.7.1  Fixed turbocell ssid's not being munged
Dec 19 2002  2.7.1  Fixed gps point logging of PHY packets

                     versions.
                    Revamped packet capture stream.  Live-decoded wep packets
                     are now logged as encrypted data again.
                    Added CRC32 checking of WEP data
Dec 16 2002  2.7.1  Added error handling for client access control 'network'
                     addresses which aren't valid network addresses (ie,
                     10.0.0.1/24 is not valid.)

                     bugs with fuzzy encryption mode
                    Added (broken) WEP decoding.  Right now this is just a 
                     bit-blender, I'm not sure it's going to give you ANYTHING
                     useful and it's not user-controllable yet.
                    Fixed WEP decoding, at least on the tests so far.  See the
                     'wepkey' config file option.  This is NOT for wep 
                     cracking - this is for decoding traffic on networks with
                     a known key (ie, monitoring stationary networks)
                    Fixed string extraction from decoded packets
                    Updated configure to look for ethereal 0.9.8
                    Minor fix to kismet_hopper (Anders Gustafsson)
                    Fixed WSP100 capture source flagging all packets as FCS
                     errors.
                    Fixed signed error w/ datasize on defective WEP packets
Dec 05 2002  2.7.1  Fixed wsp100 cygwin header
                    Started adding viha support.  VIHA SUPPORT DOES NOT WORK
                     CURRENTLY.
Dec 03 2002  2.7.1  Fixed kismet_monitor and kismet_unmonitor to work with the
                     new source definitions.
Dec 02 2002  2.7.1  Tweaked how frontend handles group naming to be faster
                     and to handle changing SSID's gracefully.
                    Changed configfile parser to allow multiple options of the
                     same type.
                    Revamped source handling again.  Multiple sources are now
                     defined by multiple 'source=' lines in the config, and
                     optionally enabled by name via the 'enablesources=' line.
                    Added filtering of PHY-layer packets from the dump file.
Dec 01 2002  2.7.1  Internal modifications to the frontend power display
                    Tweaked byte count details
                    Updated turbocell code
                    Updated frontend to handle turbocell ssid changes
Nov 30 2002  2.7.1  Fixed kismet_hopper for cisco_cvs
Nov 29 2002  2.7.1  Changed client back to only updating once per second - 
                     massive speed improvements.
                    Fixed handling of adhoc probe/ssids
                    Changed "Lucent Outdoor Router" to "Turbocell"
                    Added more complete turbocell dissection (Turbocell ID,
                     name, and mode extraction)
Nov 28 2002  2.7.1  Happy thanksgiving
                    Fixed tcpserver code for tracking the number of clients
                     using a protocol reference to actually have code, not
                     just a placeholder.
                    Sped up main filtering method
                    Added size column
                    Groups now aggregate data size
                    Profiling and speedboosts to kismet_client
Nov 27 2002  2.7.1  Updated kismet_hopper to work with the new source specs
Nov 26 2002  2.7.1  Removed user-specified capture engines.  They were 
                     redundant with the card type and led to misconfigurations.
                    Removed the linux-wireless generic capture engine entirely,
                     it was deprecrated and worthless.
Nov 25 2002  2.7.1  Enormous rewrite of the client-server protocol.  This will
                     have little impact on users of the builtin kismet
                     interfaces, but all external client authors should read
                     docs/DEVEL.client.  Also includes many fixes to the
                     server behavior and revamped commands.
                    Fixed reconnecting under new server code
                    Added build number to connect output
                    Changed 'tr' use in scripts to avoid errors with some 
                     busybox implementations
                    Changed kismet_curses to kismet_client
                    Fixed soundhandler termination conditions

                    Fixed WSP100 reporting signal level as quality
                    Put MAC address back in packtype display
Nov 15 2002  2.7.1  Fixed kismet_monitor calling kismet_hopper for new sources
                    Fixed broke probe_req handling caused by the new packet
                     categorizer.
Nov 13 2002  2.7.1  Fixed packetracker incorrect handling of interdistribution
                     data packets.
                    Added kismet_hopper support for the wsp100
Nov 12 2002  2.7.1  Free()'d initial memory allocated for config file parsing
                     in all components, fixed secondary case of kismet_curses
                     not terminating sound/speech forks on an initial conenct
                     failure.
                    Initial tracking of data in bytes through a network
                    Fixed failure to dup some strings before clearing the
                     config memory.
Nov 11 2002  2.7.1  Updated kismet_unmonitor to work with new source format

                     the initial client connection failed.
                    Updated kismet_hopper to work with new source format

                     hopping on multiple cards (-d to kismet_hopper)
Nov 10 2002  2.7.1  Initial support for multiple capture sources on one server.
                     MAJOR CHANGES TO THE CONFIG FILE - READ THE NEW DEFAULT

                    Improved XML/CSV/etc export speed
                    Inlined network sorting operators for speed
                    Added __attribute__ ((packed)) to packet fragments

                     with the generic card type)
Nov 07 2002  2.7.1  Various errno cleanups throughout the source

Oct 20 2002  2.6.2  Released 2.6.2 - Bugfixes and minor feature enhancements
                     from the -devel tree.  This is just a maintenance release.
                    Possible fix for festival speech offsets
                    Revamped data file writing code to use temp files and
                     unlink/rename them.  Should help prevent truncated data
                     files (netxml, cisco, network, csv) in a power-off
                     situation.  Only really relevant for headless sniffers.
                    Added control-L to redraw the entire screen in the panels
                     frontend (good for drawing corruption).
                    Added better searching for related netxml files - gpsmap
                     will look in the same directory as the gps file.  This
                     should make relocating GPS files much easier.
                    Tweaked gpsmap range-circle calculation to use average
                     distances to all network points from the average center.
                    Merged gpsmap by ge0 to allow setting track width
                    Merged gpsmap by tz to use Tiger census data

                     bind to the requested port
                    Fixed bug in default IP range reading
                    Fixed segfault when wtap local dumping can't open a file

Oct 20 2002  2.7    Possible fix for odd behavior with festival speech
Oct 19 2002  2.7    Revamped data file writing code to use temp files and
                     unlink/rename them.  Should help prevent truncated data
                     files (netxml, cisco, network, csv) in a power-off
                     situation.  Only really relevant for headless sniffers.
Oct 13 2002  2.7    Segfault fix in panel frontend groups, various other minor
                     bugfixes in client and multiserver code.
                    Added control-L to redraw the entire screen in the panels
                     frontend (good for drawing corruption).
                    Added better searching for related netxml files - gpsmap 
                     will look in the same directory as the gps file.  This
                     should make relocating GPS files much easier.

                    ! Added forced suid priv drops - see kismet.conf (new 
                     option suiduser).  Even if started as root, Kismet will
                     drop privs to the specified user.  This is more secure.
                     It is a good thing.

                    Fixed default config to have 'cardtype' instead of 'card'
Jul 08 2002  2.3    Rewrote all of the docs to bring them up to speed
                    Fixed segfaulting bug in panels frontend if there were no
                     network (caught by Darren)
                    Merged patches from Darren to handle control chars in SSIDs
                     better and to detect IPs from TCP.
                     ** Make sure to remove your ~/.kismet/ip_map file and

                     Reset your PCMCIA instead.
                    Merged *_monitor into kismet_monitor to handle all cards
                    Rewrote monitor command line opts, added ability for
                     monitor to launch hopper automatically.
                    Rewrote prism2hopper into kismet_hopper which handles
                     orinoco cards as well now.
                    Changed 'kismet' to use /bin/sh
                    Added detection of kismet_hopper still running
                    Removed bash-specifics from 'kismet' script.
                    Added more manuf. info and IP ranges
                    Added user-control-kill file for kismet_hopper so 'kismet'
                     script can terminate it.
                    Fixed longstanding bug with factory IP assignment.  I don't
                     know how it persisted this long.
                    Fixed text window line length bug
                    Squished very long-standing bug which caused the network
                     list to be shortened by 1 during autosort and which caused
                     the network scroll to be offset sometimes.
                    Fixed bug in tcpclient that made it not detect the server
                     had halted.  Changed text in panels to show 'Discon'
                     instead of 'Elapsed' if the server has disconnected.
                    Fixed 'paused' not being displayed on string dump
Jul 06 2002  2.3    Fixed dumpwindow being paused all the time

                     Docs to come soon.
Jul 04 2002  2.3    Changed next/prev network keys in network details to 
                     'n' and 'p' since + and - are used for scrolling 
                     elsewhere
                    Actually fixed -u on kismet_curses this time
Jul 03 2002  2.3    Fixed some spelling errors in configure (Thanks erik)
                    Fixed segfault-on-exit of GPSMap (finally!)
                    Confirmed that gpsmap works with ImageMagick 5.4.7
                    gpsmap now looks for a network.xml.gz file if a specified
                     network.xml can't be found and zlib is enabled.
                    Added handling of BSD pcap headers
                    Tweaked configure to disable ethereal support instead of
                     stopping if glib isn't found.
Jul 02 2002  2.3    Added configure test for group 'man'

                    Added error catcher to pcapsource for setting nonblock
                    Re-enabled compiler optimization (-O2.  Why did this get
                     turned off?)
                    Fixed configure script to detect BSD correctly
                    Fixed -u parameter to kismet_curses
                    Restored libz support to gpsmap and expat parsers

                     No support from panels UI yet (soon)
                    Applied client->server communications patch from Ian
                     Major changes to the client/server arch
                     Client commands to server, socket fixes, server queuing.
                     Server source pausing (not supported by panels client
                     at the moment).
                    Applied gethostbyname patch from Ian (I never used the
                     hostname and it caused problems, so I just took it out.) 
                    Completely rewrote windowing internals of panel_source.
                     Added support for multiple popups, context help for each
                     popup, and general massive code cleanups in windowing code.
Jun 30 2002  2.3    Fixed minor off-by-4 error in prism2source (thanks Ian)
Jun 29 2002  2.3    Fixed gpsmap to handle old XML files with the first/last
                     gps coordinates.
                    Rolled in prism2hopper change from Stefan Schlott to allow
                     custom channel orders for hopping
                    Rewrote weak packet dumping to be compatable with modern
                     airsnort versions
                    Scaled GPS speeds to feet/sec and meters/sec when under 
                     0.5 miles/hr or kilometers/hr
Jun 28 2002  2.3    Fixed gpsmap doing bad things with interpolation if tracks
                     were turned off
                    Tweaked interpolation code, should make some more realistic
                     results.
                    Updated gpsmap man page
                    Rolled in gpsmap change to add user scaling independent of
                     user map centering (-S).  (Thanks bob@internetbob.com)
Jun 27 2002  2.3    Fixed really stupid error in no-beacon-logging.  Now it
                     actually works.
                    Made configuration inconsistencies a lot more forgiving
                     (gps support not added won't kill us if we ask for gps,
                     for instance.)
Jun 26 2002  2.3    Added 'beaconlog' config option to turn off logging of
                     beacon packets to the datafile
                    Added 'compresslogs' config option to compress the logs if
                     we have libz (as yet unsupported)
Jun 25 2002  2.3    Finished kismet2xml - -n network file option to link the
                     network XML file added.  Fixed ending of gps-run tag.
                    Bugfix to time output in gps xml
Jun 24 2002  2.3    Worked on context help - panelfront help system very broken
                     right now.
                    Wrote kismet2xml in the extras/ directory.  Converts binary
                     to XML.  You'll have to manually add the network file
                     reference for now.
Jun 21 2002  2.3    Fixed pcap prismheader code.  Helps to read from the right
                     variable.
                    Updated prism2 and pcap docs.
                    Flagged use of the prism2 driver as deprecated
                    Tweaked periodic write messages

                     killing us.
Jun 20 2002  2.3    Slow week.  Sorry.
                    Started adding support for drivers that prepend additional
                     data to the pcap packets (wlanng in some modes, and BSD
                     hermes)
                    pcapsource supports wlan-ng extra data (prismheader=true
                     on wlanctl-ng) for quality reporting in pcap mode.
                    Trap EN10MB link type (non monitor mode)

                    Bugfixes to gpsmap.
Jun 10 2002  2.3    More work on gpsmap supporting xml.
                    gpsmap now works with XML (woo, that took way too long).
                     fix for segfault at termination coming soon, as well as
                     new features available via gpsmap reading the network xml

                     (thanks Francois)
                    Tweaked panel scrolling code, hopefully this will fix some
                     of the problems with scrolling networks (thanks again
                     Francois for a point in the right direction).
                    Worked more on expat parser, no, gpsmap doesn't work again
                     yet.
                    Finished network XML expat parser.  gpsmap still doesn't 
                     work but it's almost there.  gps xml parser is next.

                     was no valid GPS data.
May 29 2002  2.3    Added persistant IP range detection (like cloaked SSIDs,
                     once an IP range is found it will be remembered).
                    Added periodic saving of datafiles, controlled by the 
                     writeinterval config file option.  Leave this out or set
                     it to zero if you don't want to write all the data files
                     until quit time.
May 28 2002  2.3    Added default Zaurus configs to Zaurus ipk build process.

                    Fixed lack of newline in tcpclient.cc
May 26 2002  2.3    Fixed all sorts of bugs in MAC filtering (they were ignored
                     but still logged in the dumpfile and in the gpslogs, which
                     leads to interesting, but bad, drawing patterns.)
                    Rolled in network-convex-hulling gpsmap patch from Faust
                     (gpsmap -H)
                    Added filter and inverse filter BSSID to gpsmap (-F, -I)
                    Added configfile support to gpsmap (to read MAC filter
                     lists.)  It will continue to work without a configfile
                     as well.

                    Fixed bug in panels interface printing total number of 
                     packets (a+b+a != a+b).
                    Added valid BSSID range checking
                    Improved probe request merging
                    Updated and typo-fixed some documentation.

                    Turned off verbose-by-default on GPSMap
                    Turned off legend option in GPSMap (Some day.  But usually
                     so many networks are graphed that it doesn't matter.)
                    Removed network color option in GPSMap (This will come back
                     some day.)
                    Added user-specified network center and scale to GPSMap
                    Changed Makefile to listen to the prefix and bin/etc paths
                     when making ipkg's.
                    Fixed bug in prism2_monitor and _unmonitor scripts.
                    Calling this 2.0pre1.  2.0 "Real soon now"
                    Added gpsmap to installed software
                    Tweaked imagemagick detection to find it more successfully.
                    Tweaked Makefile to print out all the files it's installing
                     (cosmetic fix only)
                    Fixed libz inclusion (this will make Zaurus users happier)
                    Fixed imagemagick detection when crosscompiling
                    Fixed ipkg generation
                    Added ``buzzme'' for Zaurus-enabled compiles/installs/ipkgs
                    Rolled in string-dump clearing patch by Dave (Caesium)
Apr 14 2002  1.5    Groups save now.  ~/.kismet/group_map.  Should be a very
                     easy format for anyone writing other UI's to use.
                    Tweaked tcpclient.cc (Faust)
                    Fixed panelfront to use name under shortname.
                    Tweaked grouping not to make 1-node groups.
Apr 13 2002  1.5    Added IP aggregation for groups.
                    Fixed bug in logfile path explosion
                    Added %h - home directory - to path explosion
                    Fixed bug in cisco tcp pushing
                    Fixed potential bug in new network tcp pushing
                    Added confdir directive to store state stuff that gets
                     written
                    Added ssid_map state file.  This maps all the SSID's 
                     discovered - once you find the SSID of a cloaked network
                     Kismet will always know about it now!
Apr 12 2002  1.5    Fixed DHCP address range detection.  Now logical-ands
                     the network mask the way it should be.
                    Fixed segfault if you tried to group w/out a tag.
                    Fixed bug in packetracker - how did this NOT segfault?
                     I'm confused.  Eh.  Whatever.  Now I know why it works.
                    Added BSSID "masking" in groups where the BSSID aggregate
                     is displayed up to divergence.
Apr 11 2002  1.5    Removed pageup/pagedown - there's no really clean way to
                     do them with grouping too.  Whine at me if you really
                     want them back and I'll consider it.
                    Removed pausing the network list - it was very counter-
                     intuitive and a pain to maintain anyhow.  Pausing is
                     still allowed in the string dump.
                    Added group expansion/collapsing
                    Added un-grouping
                    Tweaked group calculations for channel
                    Moved +/- from scroll up/down to expand/collapse of groups
                     I think this makes more sense, convince me if you don't
                     agree.
                    Restored network detailed info as group-friendly.
                    Fixed some glitches with the GPS segments of networks, 
                     (large random numbers in the coordinates and speeds when a
                     GPS was not hooked up)
                    Added XmitPower: 1 to cisco_monitor to try to tone down the
                     beacon transmit problem.
                    Group titling works now
Apr 10 2002  1.5    UI works again with groups skeleton
                    GROUPING WORKS but is not currently saved, loaded, etc.
                    Fixed numerous showstopping bugs in panels UI that just
                     hadn't reared their heads yet.  Several segfaults gone.
Apr 09 2002  1.5    Fixed kismet2cwgd to not call every network __TRACK__.
                     (thanks Magnus)
                    Turned off track-jump warnings in gpsmap
                    Completely broke panels UI adding groups.
Apr 08 2002  1.5    Added network sort info to the top of the network panel
                    Fixed bug in network sorting, but at least it was a 
                     consistent bug so it wasn't visible.
                    Moved group code into frontend.h and created frontend.cc
Apr 07 2002  1.5    Fixed adhoc double-counting and added adhoc_data packet
                    Fixed .network dump again, helps to fix it right the first
                     time.
                    Rewrote GPS tracking - now saves min/max coordinates and
                     speed.
                    Rewrote network dump for new GPS
                    Rewrote XML for new GPS, updated 1.2 DTD
                    Rewrote CSV for new GPS, updated SQL definition.
                    Added coordinates to network details in panel UI
                    Fixed bug in XML output that tied network ranges to GPS
                     presence.
                    Fixed bug in tcp client that obscured multiple STATUS
                     triggers in a single read loop
                    Cleaned old sorting cruft out of tcpclient
Apr 06 2002  1.5    Added --enable-zaurus to turn on extra zaurus features
                    Added imagemagick version detection to configure
                    Added runtime muting (Dan's a whiny bitch ;P )
                    Fixed network output bug
Apr 05 2002  1.5    Fixed configure -lpanel for arm-crosscompile not linking 
                     -l*curses during the test.
Apr 04 2002  1.5    Finished kismet2cwgd perl code to convert to a common 
                     GPS format.
                    Fixed kismet script refering to ncurses
Apr 03 2002  1.5    Added missing includes to configfile.cc on some 
                     compilers.
                    Started perl gps converter to common format
                    Fixed duplicate fields in CSV/SQL extra file.
Apr 02 2002  1.5    Fixed segfault in new power code & gpsdump.  Dereferencing
                     nulls is a Bad Thing.
                    Tweaked how power is logged to be not-broken.
                    Gave /proc/net/wireless power info back to the Generic
                     capture source.
                    Added --disable-gps configure option for handheld systems
                     with no possibility of GPS support (or no desire for GPS
                     support).  This trims about 20k off the server executeable.
                    Fixed power reporting client/server glitch
                    Moved ``ncurses'' gui to ``curses'', ncursefront* to 
                     cursesfront*, kismet_ncurses to kismet_curses, etc.
                    Added ability to disable curses UI and leave panels UI
                    Fixed stripping of binaries under ``make install''
Apr 01 2002  1.5    I hate April 1.
                    Wrote XML dtd 1.1 to incorporate ``type'' on each network.
                    Added network type to CSV output and updated example SQL
                    Added network type to .net output
                    Added prism2 packet-header power detection as discussed
                     on the mailing list.  Has not been well tested yet however
                    Recoded entire power-level detection scheme.
                    Fixed packet timestamps for some capture types.
Mar 31 2002  1.5    Fixed potential problems with GUI data string lengths.
                    Added string dump to list printable strings in data packets
                    Added dump window pausing
                    Fixed bug in the client socket code that didn't set the
                     socket to be nonblocking.
Mar 30 2002  1.5    Fiddled with how the client reads data to help prevent the
                     socket buffer getting full and breaking.
                    Tweaked the blank SSID detection to treat non-0 length
                     SSID's of all spaces as 'NO SSID' and to continue trying
                     to do cloak detection on them.
                    Improved 802.11 packet dissection to catch severely 
                     malformed packets.
                    Fixed ncurses detection glitch
                    !! autoconf is now cross-platform, --host=arm-linux works.
                    Tweaked noise packet sound conditions to favor data sound
                     over junk sound.
                    Added wireless-active test to configure to make crossbuild
                     work smoothly.
                    Moved default Ethereal source dir to 0.9.3.
Mar 29 2002  1.5    Tweaked beaconing detection code again
                    Tweaked XML and completed DTD.  XML output now validates.
                    Added pausing of the network display
                    Tested yesterdays GPS/segfaulting fix, it works.
                    Moved card power levels in panels interface to 'l' instead
                     of 'p'.
Mar 28 2002  1.5    Added ``extra'' directory with bits (XML and SQL 
                     definitions)
                    Finished panels resizing when windows resize.
                    Wrote XML exporter  (Fear not embedded fans, this doesn't
                     require any extra libs.  The DTD is in extra/ and at 
                     http://kismetwireless.net/kismet-1.0.dtd).
                    Found and stomped insidious little bug in the gpsd code
                     that would lead to a segfault under certian buffer
                     conditions.
                    Added better GPSD parsing.
                    Started framework for special argument parsing for 
                     kde/gtk frontends.
                    Fixed adhoc beaconing handling to be not-dumb.
Mar 26 2002  1.5    Removed packetracker.h include from gpsmap
                    Cleaned up a lot of creeping crud with config.h and various
                     files.  Should fix some compile problems on .96 and 3.0 
                     gcc versions.
                    Added README.bsd
                    Un-stupided packetracker.h including itself.  Damn fingers
                     doing their own autocomplete.
                    Fixed configure's handling of versiontiny of linux kernel
                     when combined with RH appending -whatever to the vers.
Mar 25 2002  1.5    Incorporated PF_SOCKET capture source patches from
                     Andreas Jellinghaus (much delayed) since I now have a 
                     copy of the pf_sock patches for wlan-ng.  This should
                     work with the APHost drivers as well as patched wlan-ng.
                    Added "pfsock" to config file
                    Removed incorrect config file comment about valid dump type
                    Removed PF_SOCKET capture stuff.  With the right patches 
                     this is done with pcap.  Read the prism2 readme for how
                     to make this work (summary:  apply the packet and promisc
                     patches from http://www.shaftnet.org/~pizza/software/ 
                     use prism2_monitor to enable sniffing and pcap capture 
                     mode.
                    Tweaked prism2 scripts to ifconfig it to promisc mode
                     to help with pf_sock/2.4.18
Mar 24 2002  1.5    Added Maxrate to the CSV output.
                    Added configuration printout at the end of autoconf
                    Fixed packet.h dumbness
Mar 23 2002  1.5    Tweaked dependencies in Makefile to accomodate BSD/gmake
                    Merged CSV (comma-seperated) output patch from
                     Reyk Floeter.
                    Moved kismet to scripts/kismet (it is a script afterall)
                    Added BSD ancontrol script, bsd_cisco_monitor.  Let me 
                     know if this doesn't work, it's untested.
                    Added #ifdef to gpsmap to prevent errors during make dep
                     when imagemagick isn't present.
                    Autodetect 'root' group, install as 'wheel' if not present
                    !! Confirmed compiling and successful running on OpenBSD!
                    Updated default ethereal path to 0.9.2
                    Unbashified Makefile if tests
                    Updated FAQ
Mar 22 2002  1.5    Started multi-host-type configure script changes. (on the
                     way to BSD support)
                    Added netlink detection to configure (and --disable-netlink)
                    Modified prism2_*monitor and cisco_*monitor to use /bin/sh
                     and to perform non-bash-centric 'if' statements
                    Removed 'killall prism2_hopper' from prism2_unmonitor. 
                     Non-linux systems have a very very different idea about 
                     what killall means and it's not likely to be what you 
                     want it to do.
                    prism2 source now respects linux netlink configure option
                    Added accept() parameter testing to work on BSD systems
                    Added getopt.h to the "fail if missing" list in configure
                    Fixed ncurses/curses interaction
                    Added FSF 'getopt.c' for non-libc-getopt systems (darwin,
                     most BSD's)
                    Added _("..") hack for systems without support for it.
                    Bugfixed panels stuff
                    !! We now compile (and concievably run, if you can get the
                     card into RFMon mode) on Mac OSX.  We should also compile on
                     BSD but as yet untested.
                    Un-stupided panel after mistyping the #ifdef.  Yeah.  I'm 
                     dumb.
                    Added stdint/inttypes autoconf detection for BSD
Mar 21 2002  1.5    (Cosmetic) cleaned up changelog to fit in 80 characters 
                    Bashed ncurses and panels around a bit to try to force them
                     to behave on some compilers.  Why the HELL did they define
                     things like ``erase()'' as a macro?  Completely screws STL.
                     Should compile on Slack 7.1 gcc again.
                    Un-stupided cisco_unmonitor script
                    Panels interface now rescales if the terminal size changes
Mar 20 2002  1.5    Tweaked make distclean
                    Fixed gpsmap stl error
                    Shuffled includes for panel.h to try to un-break 
                     compilation on some versions of gcc.
                    Fixed guisound_gps twice in default/sample config.
                    Tweaked kismet script (thanks kev)
                    Install wavs into $PREFIX/share/kismet/wav/foo (thanks kev)
                    Panel detailed info scrolling
                    Tweaked various other panels bits.  Bugfixes to all 
                     edge-position calculations.
Mar 19 2002  1.5    Panels work.
Mar 18 2002  1.5    Panels UI work.  Network Info begins to function.
Mar 17 2002  1.5    Further un-stupided the scripts
Mar 16 2002  1.5    Beacon interval detection
                    Rewrote fixed-header dissection
                    Added info, mask, gateway columns
                    Trimmed some cruft and old commented code out of various 
                     files.
                    Added max data rate detection
                    Added max rate column
                    Fixed pagedown scrolling
                    Un-broked cisco scripts.
                    Fixed default column to show "packets" instead of "data"
                    Re-enabled probe request display.
Mar 15 2002  1.5    Custom column order in panel UI (config support coming soon)
                    cisco_monitor and prism2_monitor scripts now pull the device
                     from kismet.conf.  --arm option removed from configure.  
                     (hey, it IS the devel tree!)
                    cisco_monitor, prism2_monitor, prism2_hopper all respect the
                     global config file ``capinterface='' option.  NOTE:  
                     CAPINTERFACE MUST BE SET CORRECTLY FOR PRISM2 CAPTURES NOW,
                     since it matters with this change.
                    Added custom column support to the config file.  Whee.
Mar 14 2002  1.5    Fixed long-standing configure bug where --enable-foo 
                     actually disabled it when enabled was the default.  Took 
                     out the --enable options altogether for the defaults, and 
                     left --disable.
                    Fixed prism2_unmonitor to use $device correctly.
                    Fixed prism2_hopper to not print stdout
                    Tweaked prism2_hopper to use popen instead of system -- 
                     should eat slightly fewer resources on small systems.
                    Fixed 'kismet' bash script to be more reliable about killing
                     off kismet_server
Mar 13 2002  1.5    Selected scrolling in panels is done.
Mar 12 2002  1.5    Fixed GPSv4.  Don't use yesterdays -devel.  Ever. 
                    Added newline to end of networksort.h (I hate gcc3)
                    Fixed scrolling
                    Worked more on generic source, but it's still highly 
                     unreliable. You should try the prism2-style monitoring 
                     patch for orinoco.
Mar 11 2002  1.5    Added user-directed scrolling to sorted netlist window
                    Added more sort types:
                     Auto          Channel       First seen
                     Last seen     BSSID         SSID
                     WEP           Packets
                    Cleaned up popup window code
                    Rewrote popup printer functions completely
                    Added wireless power stats popup window
                    Fixed GPS display
                    Added map support for the horrible GPSv3 format which 
                     accidentally crept into some -devel releases
                    Added GPSv4 logging and mapping (adds signal quality and 
                     power, as well as expands the maximum number of networks 
                     in 1 file to 4096, previously 256)
Mar 10 2002  1.5    Added panels help menu
                    Added custom sorting and lots of panel UI work, no sense 
                     listing every single little thing yet
Mar 09 2002  1.5    Started to un-break generic source but still needs testing.
                    Added broadcast warning to generic source
                    Added libwiretap wtap_read parameter checking to autoconf 
                     to handle different wiretap versions.
                    Rolled panel and ncurses into kismet_ncurses
                    Added autoconf option to disable panels 
                    Fixed ncurses display glitch on status
                    Fixed client display for network decay times and sniff 
                     duration
Mar 08 2002  1.5    GPSMap will fit the map to actual network data instead of 
                     track data if track drawing is disabled.
                    Recoded network export to only export new networks.  Should
                     fix the problem of the GUI not listing new networks beyond
                     a certian number.
                    Fixed kismet.conf default 'speed' type (should have been 
                     'speech')
                    Added GPS lock aquired and lost sound events
                    Fixed a bug in network and packet counting that would have 
                     caused problems with festival speech if sound was also 
                     enabled.
                    Fixed compile problem with prism2hopper
                    Worked on generic capture source more.  Broke it.
Mar 07 2002  1.5    Slow coding day, sorry.
                    Merged prism2_monitor and arm2_monitor, rejoined 
                     prism2_hopper and arm2_hopper.  Introduced configure option
                     --enable-arm to set specific options.
                    Tweaked prism2_hopper to use Frank's channel order and to 
                     support international channels (-i).
                    Eliminated shell call in prism2_hopper, now calls wlanctl 
                     directly.
Mar 06 2002  1.5    Cleaned up ARM build process
                     Added 'arm' makefile target to build arm stuff only
                     Copied prism2_hopper to arm2_hopper to call the 
                      arm2_monitor scripts automatically
                     Built new ipkg of the latest devel code with all 
                      accompanying fixes and improvements.
                    Fixed kismet_server never writing packet tracker status 
                     updates, even in talkative mode.
                    Started panels client
                    Put gui= back into config, kismet script now obeys it
                    Kismet script now has absolute paths based off the configure
                     values to the server and client binaries
                    Added std namespace and compliant stl header files (thanks 
                     Million!) This should fix some/all of the gcc3 issues.
                    Fixed gpsmap glitch that caused 'streaking' across the map.
                     I think ultimately this lies in ImageMagick, but I've 
                     eliminated the cause.
                    ImageMagick 5.4.3-11 appears to have the fixed circle code 
                     gpsmap needs.  
                    Changed map fetch url in gpsmap from mblast to myblast (per Stefan's 
                     suggestion).  This seems to make it work in Europe and the US.  Let 
                     me know if it suddenly breaks it for you.
                    Won't do power calculations if theres no power data in the gps file.
                    Added GPS Version 1 file support to gpsmap (and ignores data from v1 
                     files for interpolation)
                    Tweaked scaling some more to handle gargantuan scales (note:  mapblast
                     adds in a distortion on global-sized maps that makes the drawng... 
                     not work.)
Mar 05 2002  1.5    Fixed --draw-center-dot to accept size correctly
                    Set gpsmap default transparency to 70%, like it claims
                    Note: ImageMagick has a bug which may lead to a segfault when drawing 
                     network ranges.  A patch should be available soon.
                    Added 8% scale increase to extreme-scale maps to comepensate for range
                     drift in the distance math.
Mar 04 2002  1.5    Added center dot drawing to gpsmap
                    Added newlines to all source files to placate some compilers
                    Fixed ``make install'' dependencies to correctly compile all components
                    Added gzip'd GPS file support -- now you can gzip all your gps logfiles
                     to save space, and gpsmap will decompress them on the fly.  
                    Added <stdio.h> to wtaplocaldump.cc
                    Added kernel version test and warning to help screen out buggy older
                     kernels.
                    Added prism2_[un]monitor and cisco_[un]monitor to make install
Mar 03 2002  1.5    Fixed 'no logging' commmand line combined with no logs defined in 
                     config file error that no logs were defined.
                    Added CPPFLAGS to Makefile
                    Added '-f' to make clean rm's to prevent complaining about files.
                    Migrated all current gpsmap drawing modes to command-line arguments,
                     see gpsmap --help.
                    Moved 'kismet' to 'kismet_server' and added 'kismet' shell script to 
                     broker starting everything in sync.
Mar 02 2002  1.5    Fixed some distance calculations for power graphing
                    wireless@kismetwireless.net mailing list is up 
                     (wireless-subscribe@kismetwireless.net to sign up)
Mar 01 2002  1.5    Fixed (Finally!!) network sorting so it orders sanely.
                    Documented GPS Map
                    Updated FAQ
                    Fixed sound /dev/null output sink -- kismet displays sound errors but
                     kismet_ncurses does not.
                    Added resolution settings for power graph
                    Added time estimate for power graph
                    Fixed GPS speed calculations
                    Fixed logfile numbering to be consistent across a run (previously
                     if the dump was numbered 2, the gps could still be 1 if there wasn't
                     a gpslog 1 already.  This was annoying.)
                    Fixed uninitialized cloaked SSID variable that led to false-positive 
                     detection of cloaked networks.
                    Added Shaw Innis' Festival speech code to speak new networks
                    Added conversion readme to help explain the differences in the new 
                     TCP-based user interface setup.
                    Added Server version reporting to interface
                    Added connection reporting to server
Feb 28 2002  1.5    Fixed reference to gpslist in configure
                    Directed all soundplay output to /dev/null so prevent it from mungling
                     the GUI.
                    Added cisco detection to tcpclient
                    Added status push and detection to server and client
                    Added status update for cloaked detection
                    Added status update for SSID detection on former data network
                    Added a few newlines to the end of config.h to stop some compilers
                     from whining.
                    Added cloaked network denotation - <ssid> for formerly cloaked networks.
                    Added consistent run-time reporting to GUI
Feb 26 2002  1.5    Added various things to ``make depend''
                    Added cisco export to GUI
                    Added version/start time export to GUI
                    !! New website, www.kismetwireless.net ... Thanks Nome!
Feb 24 2002  1.5    Added config file support to ncurses GUI, added correct config file
                     support to kismet itself as far as allowed hosts and ports.
                    Added kismet-ncurses to the installed binaries.
                    Added IP filtering for UI serving 
Feb 23 2002  1.5    Added sound support to ncurses network GUI, fixed numerous bugs.
Feb 22 2002  1.5    Added increased error detection for gps sockets.  This should fix a 
                     segfault issue when connecting to broken gpsd's.
                    Changed #ifdef 0 to #ifdef DISABLED (staging area before I completely
                     remove a block of code) -- apparently some gcc versions don't like 
                     this.
Feb 21 2002  1.5    Added ncurses_kismet to ``make clean''
Feb 20 2002  1.5    First iteration of the new TCPIP-based GUI socket.  More to come soon.
                    Implemented GPS remote record
                    Implemented TIME remote record
                    Implemented NETWORK remote record
Feb 17 2002  1.5    Got mentioned in InfoWorld.  Cool
                    Added interpolated power graphing to gpslist, but it's still got a 
                     long way to go.
                    Fixed gpslist map sizing (again).
                    Added map greyscaling to gpslist
                    Added (rudimentary) imagemagick detection to configure script.
                    Added multiple-GPS-dump loading to gpslist
Feb 14 2002  1.5    Added signal power logging to the GPS trackfile

Feb 13 2002  1.4.1  !! 1.4.1 released with GPS logfile updates.

Feb 12 2002  1.5    Fixed bug in GPS logging and network updating.
Feb 12 2002  1.5    Moved prism2_[un]monitor to arm2_[un]monitor for arm packages, changed
                     wlan0 to eth0 in arm2_[un]monitor scripts since Zaurus' wlan-ng 
                     drivers map to eth0 instead of wlan0.
                    Added ``prism2_hopper'' prism2 channel hopper control program
                    Added ``killall prism2_hopper'' to prism2_monitor and prism2_unmonitor
                    Fixed stupidity with killall prism2_hopper (prism2_monitor ch nokill)
                    Added WEP disable to prism2_monitor
Feb 11 2002  1.5    Added logic to gpsdrive to find a MapQuest map of the right scale
                     to hold all the sample points. (gpslist)
                    Added ImageMagick support to draw translucent networks over 
                     downloaded maps (gpslist)
                    Added travel path drawing support (gpslist)
                    Fixed scaling/centering logic (gpslist)
Feb 10 2002  1.5    Tweaked gpslist code to average distance, speed, 
                     and alt.  Stole code from GPSDrive to convert lat/lon into
                     x and y pixel coordinates on a mapquest image, added logic
                     to find average center of a network.
Feb 09 2002  1.5    Tweaked DS packet handling slightly to do additional MAC 
                     matching.
                    Added Tag133 handling to extract "extra info" that Cisco (and 
                     maybe others) put at the end of their beacon packets.
                    Fixed range calculation for gpslist
Feb 08 2002  1.5    Added patch from Jason Luther to match probe responses with
                     "closed" networks that cloak the SSID until a probe is 
                     performed.  This should help clear up a lot of the "No SSID"
                     and blank SSID networks.
                    Fixed silly termination not calling gui->EndDisplay() bug caused
                     by the SIGHUP catcher.
                    Added prism2 scripts to kismet-arm branch.
                    ARM port verified to work.  New ARM binaries released.
                    Sharp Zaurus ipkg released.
Feb 05 2002  1.5    Added detection of pcap/pcap.h for some installations.
                    Added packet-source specific fuzzy encryption
                    Added min/max coordinate recording to gpslist
                    Added earth distance calculation to gpslist (Thanks Faust)
Feb 04 2002  1.5    Fixed --disable-wireless configure option
                    Added "make checkconfig" and config file versioning
                    Added "fuzzy" encryption detection (see the README
                     file for details.)
Feb 03 2002  1.5    Added SIGTERM catcher
                    Added --disable-wireless configure option
                    Added SIGHUP catcher
                    Dewalled wtaplocaldump (unsigned to signed comparison)

Feb 02 2002  1.5    ARM binaries released (Please test)

Feb 02 2002  1.5    Started test compiling for ARM platform
                    Added stdio.h includes where needed (errors if pcap and wtap 
                     both disabled)
                    Added ncurses frontend scaling to drop fields from the display
                     when on a small screen (primarily for ARM port)
                    Added default path to ethereal 0.9.1
                    Fixed --without-ethereal configure complaint
Feb 01 2002  1.5    Removed Probe Request tracking until a better means of doing
                     it is found.  This fixes the "split network" problem where
                     the data will be listed under "no ssid" and the LLC listed 
                     correctly.

Jan 29 2002  1.4    Kismet 1.4 released -- Happy linux world!
                    Main enhancements:
                     GPS Support
                     Repaired Prism/2 Support
                     AP->AP packet dissection (from_ds and to_ds = 1)
                     Improved packet dissection
                     Numerous bugfixes

Jan 29 2002  1.3    Improved 'gpslist' demo program
                    Tweaking network display sort algo
                    Updated/synced FAQ
                    Fixed SSID glitch when upgrading a data network to a full
                     network if the SSID field is empty.
                    Fixed channel glitch when upgrading a data network to a full
                     network -- upgraded data networks are now assigned the correct
                     channel.
                    Eliminated potentialy fatal error in CDP dissection (snprintf %s)
                    !! Recoded packet protocol detection/dissection - resolved 
                     numerous flaws and now supports ap->ap packets correctly.
                    Fixed segfault on wtapfile loading if the file did not exist.
                     *note* - wtapfile loading occurs AFTER a priv drop, so this should
                     not be a vulnerability.
                    Fixed crypt packet detection - Yikes, this one was REALLY broken,
                     did I just delete a line accidentally while editing tonight?
Jan 28 2002  1.3    Revamped log definitions in kismet.conf to match command 
                     line style of comma-seperated logtypes on a single line.
                    !! Config file change
                    Finished defining gps dump file type.  
                    Added GPS dumping
                    Included demo program to extract GPS dumps
Jan 26 2002  1.3    Fixed network dump to order by network detection (MUCH easier
                     to read now!)
                    Fixed ncurses GUI to trim network lists efficiently & moved
                     tracker internals to vectors
                    Updated documentation for flags, compiling, gps.
Jan 25 2002  1.3    Better error catching and reporting for prism2source
                    My own GPS finially came in the mail.
                    Fixed "make forceinstall"
                    Ignoring "ENOBUFS" error in prism2 capture.  This should 
                     eliminate the problem of Kismet terminating unexpectedly
                     during prism/2 captures.
Jan 24 2002  1.3    Added more GPS support, gps error handling, made GPS usable.
                     Thanks to Tomcat for the loan of the Etrex
                    Fixed "generic wireless" packetsource dependence on libpcap
                     in kismet.cc
                    Generic Wireless packetsource disables weak, dump, and cisco
                     logs, since they're unsupported with this data type.
                    Added generic suid-warning
Jan 23 2002  1.3    Completely revamped frontend and packet handler methods.  
                     Frontends are now modular to allow a future GTK frontend.
                    Tied GPS to PacketHandler and ncurses front end and added
                     config support.
                    !! Config file change
                    I couldn't have planned this better: "0x8058466 in main 
                      (argc=4, argv=0xbffff974) at kismet.cc:666"
                    !! First release of GPS-enabled Kismet.
Jan 22 2002  1.3    Changed pcapsource nonblocking hack to use pcap_fileno(), which 
                     I completely forgot existed and is a much better solution than
                     a partial struct cast
                    GPSD support but no ties to the frontend
                    Started converting frontend to a modular class
Jan 20 2002  1.3    Fixed version in statup status bar
                    !! Added generic linux-wireless packet source.  This supports,
                     (minimally) Wavelan and any other linux-wireless compatable
                     card, with or without RF Monitoring.  READ THE DOCS FOR 
                     THIS, it is NOT as full featured as the rest of the packet
                     engines by ANY stretch of the imagination.

Jan 19 2002  1.2.1  !! Release version 1.2.1

Jan 19 2002  1.2.1  Fixed include and casting error in pcapsource.cc nonblocking 
                    io "fake" for old pcap's (thanks pkcp)

Jan 19 2002  1.2    !! Release version 1.2

Jan 19 2002  1.2    Moved version number to 1.2
                    Completed autoconf support (default include in code now matches
                     --prefix, other cleanups)
                    Added local pcap-dumper to write dumpfiles in the absence of 
                     a functional wiretap (wiretap used if present, local dumper 
                     used if no wiretap is available.)
                    Updated documentation
                    Updated FAQ to synchronize with website.
                    Added (minimal) mixed-endian support.  This should only really 
                     affect the local dumper code.
                    !! Implemented Guy Harris' suggestion about how to force 
                     nonblocking IO on non-cvs libpcaps.  No more pcap-devel required!
                    Added configure option to override wiretap dumper and use local
                     dumper code.
                    Fixed stdio include deficiency when pcap and wiretap both disabled
Jan 18 2002  1.1    Changed all Jan 2001 changelog references to 2002.  Come on,
                     NOBODY caught this?
                    !! Moved entire project tree to autoconf
                    Moved 'config.[h|cc]' to 'configfile.[h|cc]'
                    Moved 'config.example' to 'kismet.conf'
                    Detect old libpcaps
                    Detect compiled ethereal
Jan 14 2002  1.1    Added FAQ to package.
                    Removed requirement for Ethereal - Packets are now handled 
                     via a "custom" common format, and dump files are now possible
                     with the common DumpFile class.
                    Wiretap dumper migrated to DumpFile format.
                    Added "dumptype" config and argument.  (warning: config change)
Jan 13 2002  1.1    Revamped sound playing method.  For some reason a fork() 
                     and exit() causes wtap file corruption.  Now uses a 
                     system() with a '&', which gives the same result.  Resolves
                     yesterdays dump corruption issues.
                    Fixed makefile message regarding config file installation 
                     so it doesn't say it's installing when it isn't.
Jan 12 2002  1.1    Const typing on packet dissectors.  Dumping (may) be broken, 
                     as yet unknown.
Jan 08 2002  1.1    Wrapped pcap.h in pcapsource.h in extern "C" {}.  Didn't 
                     create an error, but could have.
Jan 07 2002  1.1    Fixed pcap.h include in packet.h even if pcap not enabled.
Jan 06 2002  1.1    Added sound support (warning: config change)
                    Added mute command line option
                    Added generic UDP address discovery
                    De-WALLed source tree
                    Better From_DS and To_DS handling of packets, will no longer
                     erroneously attempt to do protocol dissection on them.
                    Fixed UDP/ARP address octet splitting
                    Updated flagset to show matched octets
                    Tweaked crypto logging
                    Added traffic decay config file option
                    Added sound hook - new network
                    Added sound hook - receiving traffic

Jan 04 2002  1.0    !! Release version 1.0

Jan 04 2002  1.0    Rewrote most documentation for general consumption.
                    Added 'make install' and 'make forceinstall'
                    Moved suid root priv drops to before where wtapfiles are 
                     opened to prevent someone from reading files they 
                     shouldn't.
                    Moved "capdev" config line to "capinterface"
                    Added "suid" option to configure
                    Moved *_promisc scripts to *_monitor, which is much closer
                     to the truth.
Jan 03 2002  1.0    Fixed DHCP detection
                    Changed "crypt" logtype to "weak" logtype
                    Added long-name command line options, wrote usage() function
                    Added reporting of failures in the GUI and pausing before
                    termination.
                    Fixed crypt file detection to use frame control fields.
Jan 02 2002  1.0    Fixed some annoying bugs (wtap_pkthdr != pcap_pkthdr)
                    Added "usage" output
                    Added support to load wtap dump files and process them as
                    live input.
                    Added additional command line switches to override the 
                    config file options.
Jan 01 2002  1.0    Added promisc/unpromisc scripts
                    Fixed encrypted packet detection
                    Fixed prism/2 capture length
                    Fixed aironet sniffing
Dec 31 2001  1.0    CDP product lists save correctly.  
                    Data/Probe networks with no SSID are migrated to 
                    named networks correctly as soon as a beacon packet is
                    received.
                    Fixed network dumpfile unlinking for captures of only
                    noisy packets.
                    Added "bad packet" buffer protection to try to prevent
                    segfaults should a bad packet escape bounds testing 
                    during dissection.
                    !! Correctly handle SUID root and drop privs as soon as
                    !! we don't need them any longer.
                    Added ability to compile without libpcap entirely for 
                    prism/2 only installations.
                    !! Added configure script to set up source directory and
                    !! libpcap support.

                    ARP dissector complete.
Dec 28 2001  1.0    Restructured display, added crypto detecting and 
                    airsnort format interesting logs, added packet-count
                    limited ethereal logs for people with weird versions 
                    that crash (Gambit) when opening large dumps, unlinking
                    of files when no network traffic, and beginnngs of 
                    TCPIP protocol dissectors to automatically extract the 
                    IP range of the network if certian protocol broadcasts
                    are seen.
Dec 25 2001  1.0    Recoded entire PacketSource engine to be class-based
